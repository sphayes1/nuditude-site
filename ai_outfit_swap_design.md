# AI Outfit Swap Web Platform (Stable Diffusion Inpainting)

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Create a user-friendly web app that lets users upload a photo and generate new clothing on a person (e.g., "Superman suit" or "black tuxedo") using **Stable Diffusion inpainting**, while preserving the person’s **face, pose, and background**.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic clothing detection and masking.
- Manual mask editing (brush/eraser tools).
- Natural-language outfit prompts.
- Photorealistic and Cartoon/Artistic output styles.
- Virtual credit-based monetization system.
- Secure data management and legal compliance.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
**Stack:** React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, Fabric.js/Konva.js for mask editing.

**Components:**
1. Image Upload & Preview
2. Auto Mask Overlay (AI-generated)
3. Mask Editing (manual brush/eraser)
4. Prompt Input (with style toggle)
5. Generation Queue & Progress UI
6. Results Gallery (compare, download, share)
7. Account & Credit Dashboard

### Backend
**Stack:** Python (FastAPI/Flask), PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, AWS S3, CDN, Stripe.

**Core Services:**
- **Inference Service:** Stable Diffusion inpainting (Hugging Face Diffusers or AUTOMATIC1111 API).
- **Segmentation Service:** YOLOv8 + SAM (Segment Anything) for automatic clothing mask generation.
- **Job Manager:** Handles job queue, image processing, and credit transactions.
- **Credit System:** Atomic credit reservation and settlement.
- **User Management:** JWT auth, account control, and role-based permissions.

## 3. Data & Storage Design

**Tables:**
- `users`: credentials, roles, and credit balance.
- `jobs`: input prompt, status, mask, and result links.
- `assets`: metadata for all uploaded/generated files.
- `credit_ledger`: immutable record of all credit transactions.

**Storage Policy:**
- Uploads and masks stored in S3 (auto-expire 24h).
- Results stored in durable S3 bucket (90-day retention).
- Signed URLs for secure user access.

## 4. Inpainting Workflow

**Pipeline:**
1. User uploads image.
2. YOLOv8 detects clothing; SAM refines precise masks.
3. Mask editable on client.
4. User enters prompt (e.g., "Superman outfit with red cape").
5. Stable Diffusion inpainting fills masked area while preserving face & pose.
6. Result stored and displayed in user gallery.

**Key Parameters:**
- `denoising_strength`: ~0.7–0.8 for clean clothing replacement.
- Prompt conditioning to maintain realism.
- ControlNet (OpenPose) optional for perfect pose retention.

## 5. Monetization System

**Virtual Credit Model:**
- 1 generation = 1 credit.
- Purchase packs (50 / 200 / 1000 credits) via Stripe.
- Free credits on sign-up.
- Automatic refund on failed or moderated jobs.

**Integration:**
- Stripe webhooks for verified credit top-ups.
- `payment_intent_id` recorded for each transaction.

- Pre- and post-generation content moderation with AI classifiers.

### B. Privacy & Consent
- Explicit checkbox: "I own or have permission for this image."
- Ban minors, deepfakes, or impersonations.
- Auto-delete uploads/masks after 24h.

### C. Policies & Rights
- Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Policy, and DMCA policy.
